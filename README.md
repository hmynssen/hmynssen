🎓 I'm a medical physicist, who has recently achived a masters degree in physics and is currently focused on my phd.
I'm self taught proggramer, starting C and later on Python. Right now I'm also learning some front-end skills, but that is a work in progress.

#### Working

📖 Also, I teach maths and physics for kids and teenagers

#### More about me
